## Spartan: Distributed NumPy

(N.B. We are currently working hard on improving our documentation; if you're interested in the project, or want to help out, please contact us at power@cs.nyu.edu)

Spartan is a distributed array language implementation, which combines a
frontend compiler with dataflow execution (like Spark) and a shared memory
backend (like Piccolo). Spartan provides most of the basic NumPy builtin
operations, which allows existing NumPy programs to be used with minimal
modification.

We also have generated [API documentation](./api-doc/index.html).
